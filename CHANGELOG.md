# Changelog

All notable changes to Verqury are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Project scaffold: repo, standard doc set (README, ADRs 0001–0005,
  engineering notes), phased build plan, Node workspace (`core/` + `app/`).
- `verqury-core` data layer: data-root bootstrap, frontmatter read/write,
  project registry (create/list/show/set-stage), guidance library
  (global + project scoped), project memory (log entries + numbered
  decisions), and a rebuildable SQLite FTS5 search index (build / incremental
  refresh / search / full rebuild).
- `verqury` CLI over the core library: `init`, `project`, `guidance`, `log`,
  `decision`, `search`, `index`, `config`, `timeline` commands.
- Electron desktop shell: project list (stage/status badges), project detail
  (narrative + stage control + merged log/decision timeline), global search,
  system tray, and a live file watcher so terminal-side edits appear without a
  restart. Vanilla renderer over a sandboxed preload bridge.
- Core: `projectTimeline` / `listLog` / `listDecisions` readers; a native-free
  `verqury-core/files` entry point; `search --json` and `timeline` CLI output.
- Guidance library: a Guidance tab browsing global + per-project guidance,
  markdown preview, copy-to-clipboard, new-from-template (kind-aware scaffold),
  and promote-to-global. Core gains `listAllGuidance` / `promoteGuidance` and
  `guidance promote` / `guidance list --all` CLI. A small dependency-free
  markdown renderer (also upgrades the project narrative from plain text).
- Artifact inbox + clipboard capture: a global Ctrl+Alt+C hotkey files the
  clipboard into the active project as a kind-classified artifact; an Inbox tab
  lists artifacts with kind filter, copy-back, retag, change-kind, and delete;
  an active-project selector. Core gains an `artifacts` module, an in-house ULID
  generator, `activeProject` config, artifact indexing, and `artifact` / `active`
  CLI commands.
- Session bootstrapper: global packet templates ([ADR-0007](docs/adr/0007-packets-are-global-templates.md))
  render against a chosen project — `{{project.*}}` vars, `{{includes}}` guidance
  globs, and `{{log:N}}` recent entries. A Bootstrap panel previews a packet and
  copies it to the clipboard or writes it to the project repo. Ships three starter
  packets (chat-ideation, terminal-build, browser-task). New `verqury packet
  list|render` CLI.
- Task router: a Tasks tab with route-laned task lists (direct / automation /
  browser-agent / human). Hand-off renders the task's payload — enriched with the
  surface's packet context — to the clipboard and marks it handed-off. Attach-report
  links a captured inbox artifact, marks the task done, and echoes a completion entry
  into the project's memory timeline. Core gains a `tasks` module and `verqury task
  add|list|status|handoff|report` CLI.

### Changed
- Renamed product Velora → **Verqury** (prior name in use by another company);
  applies to package names, CLI command, data root, and all docs.
